Really happy to announce that we're going to be having an event to mark the end of _Response to a Request_ at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin on February 2nd. Thanks to the gallery's support, we have commissioned three final (definitely final) responses - from Mike McCormack, Isabel Nolan, and Stephen Sexton - which will be read on the night. As with all the other responses, these last three will not be archived. 

I'm pretty sure it's certain to be a great night, so would be wonderful to see you there. Tickets are free but limited, and can be booked [here]( "https://t.co/bqEL9jCwTE").
