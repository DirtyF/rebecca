link: 'Writing in Bad New Days: Art, Criticism, Emergency (2015), the august art critic
  Hal Foster utilises Dadaist Hugo Ball’s idea of mimetic exacerbation as a way of
  thinking through what he sees as the most pressing remit of recent art. Mimetic
  exacerbation, quickly outlined, means to firmly grasp the present and to refashion
  it, its hue yanked up to its highest pitch. It means to excessively and obscenely
  repackage the present so as to highlight its absurdity. At some obscure point along
  this process, we are assured, criticality takes place. Still, Foster acknowledges
  that this is a difficult act to pull off; it runs the risk, as he puts it, of being
  mistaken for ‘an affirmation, even a celebration, of the capitalist garbage bucket’.
  The tricky thing is to distinguish between the two — between criticality, and its
  semblance.'
