Really happy to announce that we'll be having an event to mark the end of _Response to a Request_, at the Douglas Hyde Gallery in Dublin, on the 2nd of February.

With the gallery's kind support, we have been able to commission three new, final responses - from Mike McCormack, Isabel Nolan, and Stephen Sexton. These will be read on the night. Like the others, they will all respond to a single image; and, also like the others, they will not be archived.

It promises to be a great night, so it would be wonderful to see you there. Tickets are free, but going fast, so you should probably book them [here]( "https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/response-to-a-request-closing-event-tickets-41871141712?aff=efbeventtix").
